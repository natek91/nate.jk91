Data compression is particularly useful in communications because it enables devices to transmit or store the same amount of data in fewer bits. There are a variety of data compression techniques, but only a few have been standardized. The CCITT has defined a standard data compression technique for transmitting and a compression standard for data communications through modems. In addition, there are file compression formats, such as ARC and ZIP.

out came the sun and dried up all the rain 
and the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again
